            <h3 class="hidden">It is a sport full of adrenaline, the joy that is experienced around the stands has no comparison, there is a whole show mounted around each game, it is a completely strategic game superior to any other sport where they only kick a ball like soccer, here the mind and physical strength are crucial, an activity where anyone can win and change the result in the end, there is always a winner, in soccer there are many games that end in a draw and that is not fun and the uniforms are striking. When you go to a football game on Saturday you know that you have an activity that takes you all day since the common thing is to have picnics, barbecues and parties around the stadium, the emotion goes beyond the meeting.</h2>
