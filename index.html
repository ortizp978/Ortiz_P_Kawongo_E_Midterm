            <h3 class="hidden">It is a sport full of adrenaline, the joy that is experienced around the stands has no comparison, there is a whole show mounted around each game, it is a completely strategic game superior to any other sport where they only kick a ball like soccer, here the mind and physical strength are crucial, an activity where anyone can win and change the result in the end, there is always a winner, in soccer there are many games that end in a draw and that is not fun and the uniforms are striking. When you go to a football game on Saturday you know that you have an activity that takes you all day since the common thing is to have picnics, barbecues and parties around the stadium, the emotion goes beyond the meeting.</h2>

            <h3 class="hidden">When asked, “What is the best sport in the world?” the answer is no doubt soccer. Not only has it been around a lot longer than American football, but it’s played in a lot more regions too. Notice the “American”? It just shows how limited the sport is to only certain regions. Soccer is also a lot more easier to play. With less rules and hassles and only one objective: get the ball into the net</h2>

            <h3 class="hidden">All you need is a ball, and sometimes you don’t even need a ball, a plastic bottle can do the job just fine. Over the years different types of games have been created that revolve around soccer because of just how versatile the sport is, and different skill moves allowing players to showcase how creative they can get.</h2>
